# Code Explanation:

This assembly code takes a string input from the user, extracts the numerical digits from it, and then prints those digits to the console.

Let's analyze the code line by line:

## Data Segment:

- `.Model Small`: Sets the memory model to small, indicating one code segment and one data segment.
- `.Stack 100`: Reserves 100 bytes of memory for the stack.
- `.Data`: Starts the data segment.
- `endl DB 10, 13, 'Ketquala', 10, 13, '$'`: Defines a byte array named "endl" and initializes it with line feed (10), carriage return (13), the string "Ketquala", another line feed and carriage return, and the string terminator '$'. This string is used for formatting the output.
- `str DB 20 dup('$')`: Defines a byte array named "str" with 20 bytes, all initialized to the '$' character. This array will store the user input string.

## Code Segment:

- `.Code`: Starts the code segment.
- `MAIN PROC`: Defines the main procedure.
- `MOV AX, @Data`: Moves the segment address of the data segment into the AX register.
- `MOV DS, AX`: Sets the data segment register (DS) to the value in AX, allowing the program to access the data in the endl and str arrays.

## Reading User Input:

- `MOV AH, 10`: Sets AH to 10, indicating the function to read a string from the keyboard with echo.
- `LEA DX, str`: Loads the effective address of the str array into the DX register, telling the function where to store the input string.
- `INT 21H`: Calls interrupt 21h, which executes the DOS system call to read the input string from the user and store it in str.

## Printing Introductory Text:

- `MOV AH, 9`: Sets AH to 9, indicating the function to print a string to the console.
- `LEA DX, endl`: Loads the effective address of the endl array into the DX register, preparing to print the "Ketquala" message.
- `INT 21H`: Calls interrupt 21h to print the string in endl to the console.

## Extracting and Printing Digits:

- `LEA SI, str + 2`: Loads the effective address of the third character in the str array into the SI register. This is because the first two characters of the input string are used to store the length of the input string.
- `PrintDigit::` Label marking the beginning of the loop to process each character.
- `MOV AL, [SI]`: Moves the character pointed to by SI into the AL register.
- `CMP AL, '$'`: Compares the character in AL with the string terminator '$'.
- `JE EndPrintDigit`: If the character is '$', jump to the EndPrintDigit label, as this indicates the end of the string.
- `CMP AL, '0'`: Compares the character in AL with the ASCII value of '0'.
- `JL NotDigit`: If the character is less than '0' (not a digit), jump to the NotDigit label.
- `CMP AL, '9'`: Compares the character in AL with the ASCII value of '9'.
- `JG NotDigit`: If the character is greater than '9' (not a digit), jump to the NotDigit label.
- `MOV AH, 2`: Sets AH to 2, indicating the function to print a character to the console.
- `MOV DL, [SI]`: Moves the digit character in AL to the DL register for printing.
- `INT 21H`: Calls interrupt 21h to print the character in DL to the console.
- `NotDigit::` Label for handling non-digit characters.
- `INC SI`: Increments the SI register to move to the next character in the string.
- `JMP PrintDigit`: Jumps back to the PrintDigit label to continue processing characters.
- `EndPrintDigit::` Label marking the end of the digit printing loop.

## Ending the Program:

- `MOV AH, 4CH`: Sets AH to 4Ch, indicating the function to terminate the program.
- `INT 21H`: Calls interrupt 21h to end the program.
- `MAIN ENDP`: Marks the end of the MAIN procedure.
- `end`: Indicates the end of the source code file.

## In summary, the code:

1. **Gets User Input**: Reads a string of up to 20 characters from the user.
2. **Prints Introduction**: Prints "Ketquala" to the console.
3. **Extracts and Prints Digits**: Iterates through the input string, checking each character. If the character is a digit (between '0' and '9'), it prints the digit to the console.
4. **Terminates**: Ends the program.
